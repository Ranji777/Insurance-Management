INSURANCE MANAGEMENT PLATFORM:
This is an insurance management platform built using Spring Boot and Java. It allows users to manage insurance policies, clients, and claims through RESTful APIs. The application uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence and an embedded database (H2 or Apache Derby) for local development.

FEATURES:
1.Clients Management: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on clients, including fetching all clients, fetching specific clients by ID, creating new clients, updating client information, and deleting clients.
2.Insurance Policies Management: Users can perform CRUD operations on insurance policies, including fetching all insurance policies, fetching specific insurance policies by ID, creating new insurance policies, updating insurance policy information, and deleting insurance policies.
3.Claims Management: Users can perform CRUD operations on claims, including fetching all claims, fetching specific claims by ID, creating new claims, updating claim information, and deleting claims.
4.Exception Handling and Validation: The platform includes robust exception handling and validation mechanisms to ensure proper API usage and maintain data integrity. Custom exception classes are used to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages for better user experience and system reliability.
