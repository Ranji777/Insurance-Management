INSURANCE MANAGEMENT PLATFORM:
This is an insurance management platform built using Spring Boot and Java. It allows users to manage insurance policies, clients, and claims through RESTful APIs. The application uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence and a mysql database (H2 or Apache Derby) for local development.

FEATURES:
1.Clients Management: Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on clients, including fetching all clients, fetching specific clients by ID, creating new clients, updating client information, and deleting clients.
2.Insurance Policies Management: Users can perform CRUD operations on insurance policies, including fetching all insurance policies, fetching specific insurance policies by ID, creating new insurance policies, updating insurance policy information, and deleting insurance policies.
3.Claims Management: Users can perform CRUD operations on claims, including fetching all claims, fetching specific claims by ID, creating new claims, updating claim information, and deleting claims.
4.Exception Handling and Validation: The platform includes robust exception handling and validation mechanisms to ensure proper API usage and maintain data integrity. Custom exception classes are used to handle errors and provide meaningful error messages for better user experience and system reliability.

It includes the following main packages:
Controllers: Contains the RESTful API endpoints that handle incoming requests and return responses. These endpoints are responsible for processing client requests and invoking the appropriate services to perform the required operations.
Models: Contains the domain models, including Client, InsurancePolicy, and Claim, with their respective properties and relationships. These models represent the data entities in the system and define the structure of the data that can be stored and retrieved.
Repositories: Contains the Spring Data JPA repositories for each domain model, providing data access and persistence. These repositories define the operations that can be performed on the data entities and provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the underlying database.
Services: Contains the business logic and services that handle data processing and manipulation. These services encapsulate the core functionalities of the system, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data entities. They interact with the repositories to perform the required operations.
Exceptions: Contains custom exception classes for handling errors and providing meaningful error messages. These exception classes are used to handle various types of errors, such as validation errors, data integrity errors, and resource not found errors, and return appropriate error responses to the clients for better error handling and troubleshooting.
The application.properties file contains the configuration for the mysql database which can be easily modified to suit your database requirements.


RUUNING THE APPLICATION LOCALLY:
Clone the GitHub repository to your local environment.
Build and run the project as springboot app using your preferred IDE. This will start the Spring Boot application and initialize the  database.
Access the APIs at the following endpoints using a tool like Postman or any web browser:
 >Clients: http://localhost:8997/api/clients
   >>To fetch or update Client by id: http://localhost:8997/api/clients/{id}
 >Insurance Policies: http://localhost:8997/api/policies
   >>To fetch or update insurance by id: http://localhost:8997/api/policies/{id}
 >Claims: http://localhost:8997/api/claims
   >>To fetch or update Claim by id: http://localhost:8997/api/claim/{id}
   
   Make sure to update the URLs with the appropriate endpoints based on your project's implementation.
